		<h1>How to Take Care of Your Teeth</h1>
		<p> 
			We understand that you don't want to visit the dentist often and that you want to care for your own teeth.
			Do not worry, Dr. John has provided several tips to make sure your teeth stay white and clean.
			<br/>
			1.  Brush your teeth twice a day using flouride toothpaste (Dr. John recommends Colgate Total Advanced Deep Clean
			toothpaste and Oral-B Triumph electric toothbrush shown below)

			2. Floss your teeth once a day (Dr. John recommends Oral-B Complete Deep Clean Ultra Floss)

			<br/>
			3. Clean your tongue; the tongue has a lot of bacteria, plus it's one of the major causes of bad breath, so use a
			tongue scraper.
			<br/>
			4. Use a alcohol-free mouthwash (Dr. John recommends Act Restoring Anticavity Flouride Mouthwash)
